# aurora-map

**What does this do?**

This will eventually be a data visualization of where people have spotted auroras and their images of what they saw. It will be shown by date over a map of the world.

**Where I'm getting the data**

Users upload images of the aurora that they have taken to the aurora gallery on spaceweather.com
